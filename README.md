- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Backwardpen
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming Minecraft Server Plugins (Java spigot). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quite a lot recently via Sololearn(.com), which is a good website to learn to code with new code languages
- If IÂ´m weird, you asking? Well, maybe. I think so
